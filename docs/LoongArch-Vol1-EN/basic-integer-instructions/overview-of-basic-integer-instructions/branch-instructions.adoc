beq     rj, rd, offs16
bne     rj, rd, offs16
blt     rj, rd, offs16
bge     rj, rd, offs16
bltu    rj, rd, offs16
bgeu    rj, rd, offs16
----

The `BEQ` instruction performs the operation that compares the values of general register `rj` and general register `rd`, if the two are equal, jump to the target address, otherwise it does not jump.

[source]
----
BEQ:
    if GR[rj] == GR[rd]:
        PC = PC + SignExtend({offs16, 2'b0}, GRLEN)
----

The `BNE` instruction performs the operation that compares the values of general register `rj` and general register `rd`, if the two are not equal, jump to the target address, otherwise it does not jump.

[source]
----
BNE:
    if GR[rj] != GR[rd]:
        PC = PC + SignExtend({offs16, 2'b0}, GRLEN)
----

The `BLT` instruction performs the operation that compares the values of general register `rj` and general register `rd` as signed numbers.
If the former is smaller than the latter, it jumps to the target address, otherwise it does not jump.

[source]
----
BLT:
    if signed(GR[rj]) < signed(GR[rd]):
        PC = PC + SignExtend({offs16, 2'b0}, GRLEN)
----

The `BGE` instruction performs the operation that compares the values of general register `rj` and general register `rd` as signed numbers.
If the former is greater than or equal to the latter, it jumps to the target address, otherwise it does not jump.

[source]
----
BGE:
    if signed(GR[rj]) >= signed(GR[rd]):
        PC = PC + SignExtend({offs16, 2'b0}, GRLEN)
----

The `BLTU` instruction performs the operation that compares the values of general register `rj` and general register `rd` as unsigned numbers.
If the former is less than the latter, it jumps to the target address, otherwise it does not jump.

[source]
----
BLTU:
    if unsigned(GR[rj]) < unsigned(GR[rd]):
        PC = PC + SignExtend({offs16, 2'b0}, GRLEN)
----

The `BGEU` instruction performs the operation that compares the values of general register `rj` and general register `rd` as unsigned numbers.
If the former is greater than or equal to the latter, it jumps to the target address, otherwise it does not jump.

[source]
----
BGEU:
    if unsigned(GR[rj]) >= unsigned(GR[rd]):
        PC = PC + SignExtend({offs16, 2'b0}, GRLEN)
----

The calculation method of the jump target address of the above-mentioned six branch instructions is to logically shift the 16-bit immediate `offs16` in the instruction code by 2 bits and then sign expand, and the resulting offset value is added to the PC of the branch instruction.

[TIP]
====
When writing assembly, you need to fill in the immediate field with the *real offset value* in bytes, i.e. `(offs16<<2)`.
====

===== `BEQZ`, `BNEZ`

Instruction formats:

[source]
----
beqz        rj, offs21
bnez        rj, offs21
----

The `BEQZ` instruction performs the operation that judges the value of the general register `rj`, if it is equal to `0`, jump to the target address, otherwise it does not jump.

[source]
----
BEQZ:
    if GR[rj] == 0:
        PC = PC + SignExtend({offs21, 2'b0}, GRLEN)
----

The `BNEZ` instruction performs the operation that judges the value of the general register `rj`, if it is not equal to `0`, it jumps to the target address, otherwise it does not jump.

[source]
----
BNEZ:
    if GR[rj] != 0:
        PC = PC + SignExtend({offs21, 2'b0}, GRLEN)
----

The jump target address of the above two branch instructions is to logical left shift the 21-bit immediate `offs21` in the instruction code by 2 bits and then sign extension, and the resulting offset value is added to the `PC` of the branch instruction.

[TIP]
====
When writing assembly, you need to fill in the immediate field with the *real offset value* in bytes, i.e. `(offs21<<2)`.
====

===== `B`

Instruction formats:

[source]
----
b       offs26
----

The `B` instruction performs the operation that jumps to the target address unconditionally.
The jump target address is to logical left shift the 26-bit immediate `offs26` in the instruction code by 2 bits and then sign extension, and the resulting offset value is added to the `PC` of the branch instruction.

[source]
----
B:
    PC = PC + SignExtend({offs26, 2' b0}, GRLEN)
----

====
When writing assembly, you need to fill in the immediate field with the *real offset value* in bytes, i.e. `(offs26<<2)`.
====

===== `BL`

Instruction formats:

[source]
----
bl      offs26
----

The `BL` instruction performs the operation that jumps to the target address unconditionally, and writes the result of adding `4` to the `PC` value of the instruction into the No.1 general register `r1`.

The jump target address of the instruction is to shift the 26-bit immediate `offs26` in the instruction code to the left by 2 bits and then sign extend it.
The shift value is added to the PC of the branch instruction.

[source]
----
BL:
    GR[1] = PC + 4
    PC = PC + SignExtend({offs26, 2'b0}, GRLEN)
----

In LA ABI, the No.1 general register `r1` serves as the return address register `ra`.

===== `JIRL`

Instruction formats:

[source]
----
jirl        rd, rj, offs16
----

`JIRL` jumps to the target address unconditionally, and the `PC` value of the instruction plus `4`; then writes the result into the general register `rd`.

The jump target address of the instruction is to logically shift the 16-bit immediate `offs16` in the instruction code by 2 bits to the left and then sign extension, and the resulting offset value is added to the value in the general register `rj`.

[source]
----
JIRL:
    GR[rd] = PC + 4
    PC = GR[rj] + SignExtend({offs16, 2'b0}, GRLEN)
----

When `rd` is equal to `0`, the function of `JIRL` is a common non-call indirect jump instruction.

`JIRL` with rd equal to `0`, `rj` equal to `1` and `offs16` equal to `0` is often used as an indirect jump from call return.
