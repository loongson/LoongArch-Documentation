==== Other Miscellaneous Instructions

===== `syscall`

Instruction formats:

[source]
----
syscall     code
----

Executing the `SYSCALL` instruction will immediately and unconditionally trigger the system call exception.

The information carried in the code field in the instruction code can be used as a parameter passed by the exception handling routine.

===== `break`

Instruction formats:

----
break       code
----

Executing the `BREAK` instruction will immediately and unconditionally trigger the breakpoint exception.

The information carried in the code field in the instruction code can be used as a parameter passed by the exception handling routine.

===== `ASRT{LE/GT}.D`

Instruction formats:

[source]
----
asrtle.d        rj, rk
asrtgt.d        rj, rk
----

The value in general register `rj` and general register `rk` are compared as signed numbers.
If the comparison conditions are not met, an exception for address bound checking is triggered.
For the `ASRTLE.D` instruction, if the value in the general register `rj` is greater than the value in the general register `rk`, an exception is triggered; for the `ASRTGT.D` instruction, if the value in the general register `rj` is less than or equal to the value in the general register `rk`, an exception is triggered.

===== `RDTIME{L/H}.W`, `RDTIME.D`

Instruction formats:

[source]
----
rdtimel.w       rd, rj
rdtimeh.w       rd, rj
rdtime.d        rd, rj
----

The LoongArch instruction system defines-a constant frequency timer, whose main body is-a 64-bit counter called StableCounter.
StableCounter is set to 0 after reset, and then increments by `1` every counting clock cycle.
When the count reaches all 1s, it automatically wraps around to `0` and continues to increment.
At the same time, each timer has a software-configurable globally unique-number, called Counter ID.
The characteristic of the constant frequency timer is that its timing frequency remains unchanged after reset, no matter how the clock frequency of the processor core changes.

The `RDTIME{L/W}.W` and `RDTIME.D` instructions are used to read constant frequency timer information, the StableCounter value is written into the general register `rd`, and the Counter ID number information is written into the general register `rj`.
The difference between the three instructions is the difference in the Stable Counter information read.
`RDTIMEL.W` reads the `[31:0]` bits of the Counter, `RDTIMEH.W` reads the `[63:32]` bits of the Counter, and `RDTIME.D` reads The entire 64-bit Counter value.
On a 64-bit processor, the 32-bit value read by the `RDTIME{L/H}.W` instruction is sign extension and written to the general register `rd`.
The `RDTIME(L/H).W` instruction is defined so that the 64-bit Counter can also be accessed on a 32-bit processor.

===== `cpucfg`
Instruction formats:

[source]
----
cpucfg      rd, rj
----

The `CPUCFG` instruction is used to dynamically identify which features of LoongArch are implemented in the running processor during the execution of the software.
The realization of the functional characteristics of these instruction systems is recorded in the series of configuration information words.
One configuration information word can be read once the `CPUCFG` instruction is executed.

When using the CPUCFG instruction, the source operand register `rj` stores the number of the configuration information word to be accessed, and the configuration information word information read after the instruction is executed is written into the general register `rd`.
In LA64, each configuration information word is 32 bits, which is written into the result register after the sign extension.

The configuration information word contains-series of configuration bits (fields), and its record form is `CPUCFG.<configuration word number>.<configuration information mnemonic name>[bit subscript]`, where the single bit configuration bit is marked as `bitXX`, which means The `XX` bit of the configuration word; the bit under the multi-bit configuration field is marked as `bitXX:YY`, which means the continuous `(XX-YY+1)` bit from the `XX` bit to the `YY` bit of the configuration word.
For example, the ``0``th bit in the configuration word No.1 is used to indicate whether to implement LA32.
Record this configuration information as `CPUCFG.1.LA32[bit0]`, where `0x1` indicates that the font size of the configuration information word is No.1, and LA32 indicates this configuration The mnemonic name of the information field is called LA32, and bit `0` means that the field of LA32 is located at bit `0` of the configuration word.
The `PALEN` field of the number of physical address bits supported by the 11th to 4th digits of the configuration word No.1 is recorded as `CPUCFG.1.PALEN[itl1:4]`.

The configuration information accessible by the `CPUCFG` instruction in the Godson architecture is listed in the table.
`CPUCFG` access to undefined configuration words will read back all `0` values.
The undefined field in the defined configuration word can be read back to any value when `CPUCFG` is executed, and the software should not make any interpretation of it.
