=== Programming Model of Basic Floating-Point Instructions

The basic floating-point instruction programming model described in this section only involves the content that application software developers need to pay attention to.
When software personnel use basic floating-point instructions to program, they are on the basis of the basic integer instruction programming model, and then proceed to involve the content described in this section.
