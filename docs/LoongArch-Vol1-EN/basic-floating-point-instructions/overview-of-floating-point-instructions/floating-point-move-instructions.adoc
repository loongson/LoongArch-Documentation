==== Floating-Point Move Instructions

===== `FMOV.{S/D}`

Instruction formats:

[source]
----
fmov.s      fd, fj
fmov.d      fd, fj
----

`FMOV{S/D}` writes the value of the floating-point register `fj` into the floating-point register `fd` in the single-precision/double-precision floating-point number format.
If the value of `fj` is not in the single-precision/double-precision floating-point number format, the result is uncertain.

[source]
----
FMOV.S:
    FR[fd][31:0] = FR[fj][31:0]

FMOV.D:
    FR[fd] = FR[fj]
----

The above instruction operations are non-arithmetic and will not cause IEEE 754 exceptions, nor will they modify the Cause and Flags fields of the floating-point control and status register.

===== `FSEL`

Instruction formats:

[source]
----
fsel        fd, fj, fk, ca
----

The `FSEL` instruction performs conditional assignment operations.

When `FSEL` is executed, if the value of the condition flag register ca is equal to 0, the value of the floating-point register `fj` is written into the floating-point register `fd`, otherwise the value of the floating-point register fk is written into the floating-point register `fd`.

[source]
----
FSEL:
    FR[fd] = CFR[ca] ? FR[fk] : FR[fj]
----

===== `MOVGR2FR.{W/D}`, `MOVGR2FRH.W`

Instruction formats:

[source]
----
movgr2fr.w      fd, rj
movgr2fr.d      fd, rj
movgr2frh.w     fd, rj
----

`MOVGR2FR.W` writes the low 32-bit value of the general register `rj` into the low 32-bit of the floating-point register `fd`.
If the length of the floating-point register is 64 bits, the high 32-bit value of fd is uncertain.

[source]
----
MOVGR2FR.W:
    FR[fd][31:0] = GR[rj][31:0]
----

`MOVGR2FRH.W` writes the low 32-bit value of the general register `rj` into the high 32-bit of the floating-point register `fd`, and the low 32-bit value of the floating-point register `fd` remains unchanged.

[source]
----
MOVGR2FRH.W:
    FR[fd][63:32] = GR[rj][31:0]
    FR[fd][31: 0] = FR[fd][31:0]
----

`MOVGR2FR.D` writes the 64-bit value of general register `rj` into floating-point register `fd`.

[source]
----
MOVGR2FR.D:
    FR[fd] = GR[rj]
----

===== `MOVFR2GR.{S/D}`, `MOVFRH2GR.S`

Instruction formats:

[source]
----
movfr2gr.s      rd, fj
movfr2gr.d      rd, fj
movfrh2gr.s     rd, fj
----

`MOVFR2GRMOVFRH2GR.S` sign extensions the low/high 32-bit value of the floating-point register `fj` and writes it into the general register `rd`.

[source]
----
MOVFR2GR.S:
    GR[rd] = SignExtend(FR[fj][31: 0], GRLEN)

MOVFRH2GR.S:
    GR[rd] = SignExtend(FR[fj][63:32], GRLEN)
----

`MOVFR2GR.D` writes the 64-bit value of the floating-point register `fj` into the general register `rd`.

[source]
----
MOVFR2GR.D:
    GR[rd] = FR[fj]
----

===== `MOVGR2FCSR`, `MOVFCSR2GR`

Instruction formats:

[source]
----
movgr2fcsr      fcsr, rj
movfcsr2gr      rd,   fcsr
----

`MOVGR2FCSR` modifies the value of the software writable field corresponding to the floating-point control and status register indicated by fcsr according to the value of the lower 32 bits of the general register `rj`.
If the `MOVGR2FCSR` instruction modifies `FCSR0` so that the bits of the Cause field and the corresponding Enables bit are both 1, or modify the Enables field of `FCSR1` and the Cause field of `FCSR2` so that the Cause bit and the corresponding Enables bit are both 1, the `M0VGR2FCSR` instruction itself No floating-point exception will be triggered.

[source]
----
MOVGR2FCSR:
    FCSR[fcsr] = GR[rd][31:0]
----

`MOVFCSR2GR` sign extensions the 32-bit value of the floating-point control and status register indicated by `fcsr` and writes it into the general register `rd`.

[source]
----
MOVFCSR2GR:
    GR[rd] = SignExtend(FCSR[fcsr], GRLEN)
----

If the floating-point control and status register indicated by fcsr in the above instruction does not exist, the result is uncertain.

===== `MOVFR2CF`, `MOVCF2FR`

Instruction formats:

[source]
----
movfr2cf        cd, fj
movcf2fr        fd, cj
----

`MOVFR2CF` writes the value of the lowest bit of the floating-point register `fj` into the condition flag register `cd`.

[source]
----
MOVFR2CF:
    CFR[cd] = FR[fj][0]
----

`MOVCF2FR` writes the value of the condition flag register `cj` into the lowest bit of the floating-point register `fd`.

[source]
----
MOVCF2FR:
    FR[fd][0] = CFR[cj]
----

===== `MOVGR2CF`, `MOVCF2GR`

Instruction formats:

[source]
----
movgr2cf    cd, rj
movcf2gr    rd, cj
----

`MOVGR2CF` writes the value of the lowest bit of the general register `rj` into the condition flag register `cd`.

[source]
----
MOVGR2CF:
    CFR[cd] = GR[rj][0]
----

`MOVCF2GR` writes the value of the condition flag register `cj` into the lowest bit of the general register `rd` and clears the other bits.

[source]
----
MOVCF2GR:
    GR[rd][0] = CFR[cj]
