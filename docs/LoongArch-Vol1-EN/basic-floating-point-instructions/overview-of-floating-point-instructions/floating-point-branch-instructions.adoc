==== Floating-Point Branch Instructions

===== `BCEQZ, BCNEZ`

Instruction formats:

[source]
----
bceqz   cj, offs21
bcnez   cj, offs21
----

`BCEQZ` judges the value of the condition flag register `cj`, if it is equal to 0, jump to the target address, otherwise it does not jump.
`BCNEZ` judges the value of the condition flag register `cj`, if it is not equal to 0, jump to the target address, otherwise it does not jump.
The jump target address of the above two branch instructions is to logically shift the 21-bit immediate offs21 in the instruction code to the left by 2 bits and then sign extension, and the resulting offset value plus the `PC` of the branch instruction.

BCEQZ:
    if CFR[cj] == 0:
        PC = PC + SignExtend({offs21, 2'b0}, GRLEN)

BCNEZ:
    if CFR[cj] != 0:
        PC = PC + SignExtend({offs21, 2'b0}, GRLEN)
