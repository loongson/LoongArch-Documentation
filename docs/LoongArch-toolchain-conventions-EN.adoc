__Note: In this document, the terms "architecture", "instruction set architecture" and "ISA"
are used synonymously and refer to a certain set of instructions and the set of registers
they can operate upon.__


== Compiler Options

=== Rationale

Compiler options that are specific to LoongArch should denote a change
in the following compiler settings:

- *Target architecture*: the allowed set of instructions and registers
to be used by the compiler.

- *Target ABI type*: the data model and calling conventions.

- *Target microarchitecture*: microarchitectural features that guides
compiler optimizations.

For this model, two categories of LoongArch-specific compiler options
should be implemented：

- *Basic options*: select the base configuration of the compilation target.
(include only `-march` `-mabi` and `-mtune`)

- *Extended options*: make incremental changes to the target configuration.

.Basic Options
[%header,cols="^1m,^3,^6"]
|===
|Option
|Possible values
|Description

|-march=
|`native` `loongarch64` `la464`
|Selects the target architecture, i.e.
the basic set of <<isa-modules,ISA modules>> to be enabled.

|-mabi=
|`lp64d` `lp64f` `lp64s` `ilp32d` `ilp32f` `ilp32s`
|Selects the base ABI type.

|-mtune=
|`native` `loongarch64` `la464`
|Selects the type of target microarchitecture, defaults to the value of `-march`.
The set of possible values should be a superset of `-march` values.
|===

- Valid parameter values of `-march` and `-mtune` options should correspond to
actual LoongArch processor implementations / families.

- In principle, different `-march` values should not imply the same set
of ISA modules.

=== Configuring Target ISA

The LoongArch ISA is organized in a "base-extension" manner.
For future updates, each component in the __base__ or __extened__ part of the ISA
may evolve independently while keeping compatibility with previous versions of itself.

[[isa-modules]]
For this purpose, the compiler should make a modular abstraction about the target ISA.
The ISA modules are divided into two categories： *base architectures* and *ISA extensions*.
A *base architecture* is the core component of the target ISA, which defines the __base__
set of functionalities like integer and floating-point operations, and is decided
by the value of `-march`. An *ISA extension* may represent either the base of a certain
__extended__ ISA component or an incremental update to it, and is enabled / disabled by
extended options.

For a complier, the final ISA configuration should be derived by applying various
ISA extension configurations from extended options to the base ISA,
which is selected via the `-march` option and consists of the base
architecture and the set of default ISA extensions.

Among all ISA modules listed below, the compiler should at least implement
one base architecture.

[[abi-types]]
=== Configuring Target ABI

Like configuring the target ISA, a complete ABI configuration of LoongArch
consists of two parts, the *base ABI* and the *ABI extension*. The former
describes the data model and calling convention in general, while the latter
denotes an overall adjustment to the base ABI, which may require support
from certain ISA extensions.

Please be noted that there is only ONE ABI extension slot in an ABI
configuration. They do not combine with one another,
and are, in principle, mutually incompatible.

A new ABI extension type will not be added to this document unless
it implies certain significant performance / functional advantage
that no compiler optimization techniques can provide without
altering the ABI.

There are six base ABI types, whose standard names are the same as
the `-mabi` values that select them. The compiler may choose to implement
one or more of these base ABI types, possibly according to the range of
implemented target ISA variants.

.Base ABI Types
[%header,cols="^1,^1,^1"]
|===
|Standard name  |Data model
|Bit-width of argument / return value GPRs / FPRs
|`lp64d`        |LP64       |64 / 64
|`lp64f`        |LP64       |64 / 32
|`lp64s`        |LP64       |64 / (none)
|`ilp32d`       |ILP32      |32 / 64
|`ilp32f`       |ILP32      |32 / 32
|`ilp32s`       |ILP32      |32 / (none)
|===

The following table lists all ABI extension types and
related compiler options. A compiler may choose to implement
any subset of these extensions that contains `base`.

The default ABI extension type is `base` when referring to
an ABI type with only the "base" component.

|===

[[default-arch-abi]]
The compiler should know the default ABI to use during its build time.
If the ABI extension type is not explicitly configured,
`base` should be used.

In principle, the target ISA configuration should not affect the decision
of the target ABI. When certain ISA feature required by explicit
(i.e. from the compiler's command-line arguments) ABI configuration
cannot be met due constraints imposed by ISA options, the compiler should
abort with an error message to complain about the conflict.

When the ABI is not fully constrained by the compiler options, the default
configuration of either the base ABI or the ABI extension, whichever is missing
from the command line, should be attempted. If this default ABI setting
cannot be implemented by the explicitly configured target ISA, the expected
behavior is *undefined* since the user is encouraged to specify which
ABI to use when choosing a smaller instruction set than the default.

In this case, it is suggested that the compiler should abort with
an error message, however, for user-friendliness, it may also choose
to ignore the default base ABI or ABI extension and select a viable,
"downgraded" ABI for the currently enabled ISA modules with caution.
It is also recommended that the compiler should notify the user about the
ABI change, optionally with a compiler warning.
For example, passing `-mfpu=none` as the only command-line argument
may cause a compiler configured with `lp64d` / `base` default ABI
to automatically select `lp64s` / `base` instead.

When the target ISA configuration cannot be uniquely decided from the given
compiler options, the build-time default should be consulted first.
If the default ISA setting is insufficient for implementing the ABI configuration,
the compiler should try enabling the missing ISA modules according to the following
table, as long as they are not explicitly disabled or excluded from usage.

== GNU Target Triplets and Multiarch Specifiers

*Target triplet* is a core concept in the GNU build system.
It describes a platform on which the code runs and mostly consists of three fields:
the CPU family / model (`machine`), the vendor (`vendor`), and the operating
system name (`os`).

*Multiarch architecture apecifiers* are essentially standard directory names
where libraries are installed on a multiarch-flavored filesystem.
These strings are normalized GNU target triplets. See
https://wiki.debian.org/Multiarch/Tuples[debian documentation] for details.

This document recognizes the following `machine` strings
for the GNU triplets of LoongArch:

[[machine-strings]]
.LoongArch `machine` strings：
[%header,cols="^1,^2"]
|===
|`machine`
|Description

|`loongarch64`
|LA64 base architecture (implies `lp64*` ABI)

|`loongarch32`
|LA32 base architecture (implies `ilp32*` ABI)
|===

As standard library directory names, the canonical multiarch architecture specifiers
of LoongArch should contain information about the ABI type of the libraries
that are meant to be released in the binary form and installed there.

While the integer base ABI is <<machine-strings, implied by the `machine` field>>,
the floating-point base ABI and the ABI extension type are encoded
with two string suffices (`<fabi-suffix><abiext-suffix>`) to the `os` field of the
specifier, respectively.

.List of possible `<fabi-suffix>`
[%header,cols="^1,^2"]
|===
|`<fabi-suffix>` |Description
|`f64`           |The base ABI uses 64-bit FPRs for parameter passing. (`lp64d` `ilp32d`)
|`f32`           |The base ABI uses 32-bit FPRs for parameter passing. (`lp64f` `ilp32f`)
|`sf`            |The base ABI uses no FPR for parameter passing. (`lp64s` `ilp32s`)
|===

__(Note: Since in principle, <<default-arch-abi,The default ISA configuration of the ABI>>
should be used in this binary-release scenario, it is not necessary to reserve
multiple multiarch specifiers for one OS / ABI combination.)__
