=== Memory Capacity Configuration Register

This set of registers is used to configure the capacity of the video memory. This register represents the mask of the memory BAR register, 0 means the corresponding bit of the memory BAR register is writable, 1 means not writable.
The number of 1's represents the memory capacity. The default memory capacity is 256MB.

Address Offset: `3838`-`383Bh`

Attribute: R/W

Default value: `0FFF_FFFFh`

Size: `32` bits
