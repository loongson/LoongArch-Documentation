|phy_cfg_done
|R/W
|PHY One access completion indicates the completion of reading and writing to PHY. Write completion indicates that the write data has been written to the PHY internal register, and read completion indicates that the read data has been returned to the to the phy_cfg_data register

|1
|phy_cfg_disable
|R/W
|0 - Read and write to this set of registers will trigger PHY configuration access operation

1 - Read or write to this set of registers does not trigger PHY configuration access operation, only a simple register read or write

|0
|phy_cfg_R/W
|R/W
|Start a read operation or a write operation.

0: Read operation

1: Write operation
