=== `PCIE_G1 PHY LO` Access Configuration Register

This group of registers is used to control the configuration access operation that generates the PCIE_G1 PHY LO internal control register.
This register controls the the lower 4 data links (lane0-3) of PCIE_G1.

Address Offset: `0610`-`0613h`

Attribute: R/W

Default value: `0000_0000h`

Size: `32` bits

|phy_cfg_data
|R/W
|PHY configuration reads and writes data. In the write operation, the data is written to this register first, and then the write operation is performed. In the read operation, the read data returned from PHY is stored into this register.

|PHY One Access Complete indicates that the read or write to the PHY is complete. Write completion indicates that the write Read completion indicates that the read data has been returned to the phy_cfg_data register.

|1
|phy_cfg_disable
|R/W
|0 - Read or write to this group of registers will trigger the PHY configuration access operation

1 - Reading or writing to this set of registers does not trigger a PHY configuration access operation, only a simple register read or write

|0
|phy_cfg_R/W
|
|R/W
|Start a read operation or a write operation.

0: Read operation

1: Write operation
