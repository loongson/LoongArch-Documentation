Offset Address: `041C`-`041Fh`

Attribute: R/W

Default value: `000a_a800h`

Size: `32` bits

This register is used to configure the routing information for the device's DMA accesses (i.e., the destination processor for the `DMA` access and the HT controller through which it passes).
Since the HT bus only supports `40`-bit addresses and the processor space (and the DMA access space) supports `64`-bit addresses, the addresses need to be transformed before and after passing through the HT bus in order to preserve the address routing information. This feature requires two supports:

. the bridge chip stores the node number information in a certain number of bits of the HT bus address;

. on the processor side, the node information is remapped to the processor's node bit field using the address translation function of the HT receive window.

The LS7A1000 implements the `DMA` access node number translation function, which allows the node number in the `64`-bit address space issued by the device to be automatically mapped to the HT address space by configuring this register.

|31:16
|dma_dest_ht
|R/W
|`DMA` access destination node routing configuration. There are 16 nodes, each bit corresponds to a node number. `bit31-16` correspond to `DMA` accesses to nodes `15-0` respectively.

`1`: Routed to HT controller `1`

`0`: Routed to HT controller `0`

|15:13
|dma_node_id_offset_ma pped
|R/W
|Address Offset of the mapped `DMA` access node number in the HT address space (relative to bit32).

`0`: Position of the node number in the HT address space from `bit32`

`1`: Position of the node number in the HT address space from `bit33`

...

`7`: The location of the node number in the HT address space starts at `bit39`

This register determines the maximum address range for `DMA` accesses to a single node. For example, when this register is configured to 0 and bit`[3:0]` is not `0`, the maximum address space for `DMA` accesses within a single node is `2^32=4GB`.

|12:8
|dma_node_id_offset
|R/W
|The address offset (relative to `bit36`) where the node number is located in the `DMA` access.

|dma_node_id_mask

|Node number mask for `DMA` accesses. This register determines the number of nodes that can be accessed by device `DMA` access.
