=== `PCIE_G0 PHY LO` Access Configuration Register

This group of registers is used to control the configuration access operation that generates the PCIE_G0 PHY LO internal control register.
This register controls the the lower 4 data links (lane0-3) of PCIE_G0.

Address Offset: `05F0`-`05F3h`

Attribute: R/W

Default value: `0000_0000h`

Size: `32` bits

|phy_cfg_data
|R/W
|`PHY` configuration reads and writes data. In the write operation, the data is written to this register first, and then the write operation is performed. In the read operation, the read data returned from PHY is stored into this register.

|phy_cfg_done
|R/W
|`PHY` One access completion indicates the completion of this read/write to the `PHY`. Write completion indicates that the write indicates that the read data has been written to the internal register of `PHY`, and the read completion indicates that the read data has been returned to the `phy_cfg_data` register.

|1
|phy_cfg_disable
|R/W
|`0` - Read or write to this group of registers will trigger the PHY configuration access operation

`1` - Read or write to this set of registers does not trigger PHY configuration access operation, only a simple register read or write

|0
|phy_cfg_R/W
|R/W
|Start a read operation or a write operation.

`0`: Read operation

`1`: Write operation
