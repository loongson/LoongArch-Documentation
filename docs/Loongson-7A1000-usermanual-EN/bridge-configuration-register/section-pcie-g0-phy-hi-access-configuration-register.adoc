=== `PCIE_G0 PHY HI` Access Configuration Register

This group of registers is used to control the configuration access operation that generates the PCIE_G0 PHY HI internal control register.
This register controls the the high 4 data links (lane4-7) of PCIE_G0.

Address Offset: `05F8`-`05FBh`

Attribute: R/W

Default value: `0000_0000h`

Size: `32` bits

|phy_cfg_data
|R/W
|PHY configuration reads and writes data. In the write operation, the data is written to this register first, and then the write operation is performed. In the read operation, the read data returned from PHY is stored into this register.

|phy_cfg_done
|R/W
|The completion of one access to PHY indicates the completion of reading and writing to PHY. Write completion indicates that the written data has been written to the PHY internal register, and read completion indicates that the read data has been returned to the to the phy_cfg_data register

|phy_cfg_disable
|R/W
|0 - Read or write to this set of registers will trigger the PHY configuration access operation

1-Writes and writes to this set of registers do not trigger a PHY configuration access operation, only a simple register register read/write

|0
|phy_cfg_R/W
|R/W
|Start a read operation or a write operation.

0: Read operation

1: Write operation
