=== `PCIE_G1 PHY HI` Access Configuration Register

This group of registers is used to control the configuration access operation that generates the PCIE_G1 PHY HI internal control register.
This register controls the high 4 data links (lane4-7) of PCIE_G1.

Address Offset: `0618`-`061Bh`

Attribute: R/W

Default value: `0000_0000h`

Size: `32` bits

|phy_cfg_data
|R/W
|PHY configures the read and write data. In the write operation, the data is written to this register before the write operation is executed; in the read operation, the read data returned from PHY is stored to this register.

|phy_cfg_done
|R/W
|The completion of one access to PHY indicates the completion of reading and writing to PHY. Write completion indicates that the written data has been written to the PHY internal register, and read completion indicates that the read data has been returned to the phy_cfg_data register

|1
|phy_cfg_disable
|R/W
|`0` - Read or write to this group of registers will trigger the PHY configuration access operation

`1` - Read or write to this set of registers does not trigger PHY configuration access operation, only a simple register read or write

|0
|phy_cfg_R/W
|R/W
|Start a read operation or a write operation.

`0`: Read operation

`1`: Write operation
