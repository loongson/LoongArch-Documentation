== HPET Controller

The HPET controller is compatible with standard specifications. Internally, it includes a 64-bit main counter and three 32-bit timers (comparators). Of the three timers, 
timer 0 supports both periodic-capable and non-periodic interrupts, while timers 1 and 2 support only non-periodic interrupts.
