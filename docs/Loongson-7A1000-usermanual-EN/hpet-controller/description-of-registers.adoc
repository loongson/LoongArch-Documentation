|0
|T0_INT_STS
|Timer `0` interrupt state.

When the timer's interrupt trigger mode is level-triggered, this timer defaults to `0`.
When the corresponding timer interrupt occurs, then the hardware will set it to `1`. Once set, software writing `1` to this timer will clear it. Once it is set, software writing `1` to this timer will clear this timer. Writing `0` to this timer will be meaningless.
When the interrupt triggering mode of the timer is edge triggering mode.
Software will ignore this bit. Software usually writes `0` to this bit.
|R/WC

The interrupt trigger mode of each timer is determined by the `Tn_TYPE_CNF` bit of the respective Configuartion and Capability register.

|T0_32MODE_CNF
|Timer `0` 32-bit mode configuration. When the timer is 64-bit, the software

|T0_SIZE_CAP
|Timer 0 Width indication.

`0`: 32-bit width

`1`: 64-bit width
|RO

|T0_PER_INT_CAP
|Timer `0` Periodic interrupt indication.

`1`: the timer is capable of generating periodic interrupts.

`0`: the timer is not capable of generating periodic interrupts.
|RO

|3
|T0_TYPE_CNF
|Timer 0 cycle interrupt configuration.
If the corresponding `T0_PER_INT_CAP` bit is `0`, then this bit is read-only and defaults to `0`.
If the corresponding `T0_PER_INT_CAP` bit is `1`, then this bit is readable and writable. It is used to enable the corresponding timer to generate periodic interrupts.
`1`: Enable the timer to generate periodic interrupts

|1
|T0_INT_TYPE_CNF
|Timer `0` interrupt type configuration.

`0`: The interrupt triggering mode of the timer is edge triggered; this means that the corresponding timer will generate an edge triggered interrupt. If another interrupt is generated, then another edge will be generated.
`1`: The interrupt trigger mode of the timer is level triggered; this means that the corresponding timer will generate a level triggered interrupt. This interrupt will remain active
until it is cleared by software (General Interrupt Status Register).

|T0_Com_VAL
|The value of the timer `0` comparator.
When the corresponding timer is configured in non-periodic mode.
the value of this register will be compared with the value of the main timer register.
If the value of the main timer is equal to the value of the comparator, a timing interrupt is generated (if; the corresponding interrupt enable is on).
The comparator value will not change due to the interrupt generation If the corresponding timer is configured in periodic mode.
interrupt is generated when the value of the comparator in the value field of the main timer is equal (if; the corresponding interrupt enable is turned on).
If an interrupt is generated, then the comparator value is accumulated from the last software write to the comparator. For example, when the comparator value is written to `0x0123h`
then an interrupt is generated when the value of the main timer is 0x123h; the comparator value is modified by hardware to `0x246h`.
When the value of the main timer reaches `0x246h`, another interrupt is generated; the comparator value is modified by hardware to `0x369h`.
Whenever an interrupt is generated, the comparator value will be accumulated; until the comparator value reaches the maximum (`0xffffffff`), then the accumulator value will continue to accumulate. For example, when the comparator value is `FFFF0000h`, and the last time the comparator was written by software, the value is `20000`.
When the interrupt occurs, the comparator value becomes `00010000h`.
