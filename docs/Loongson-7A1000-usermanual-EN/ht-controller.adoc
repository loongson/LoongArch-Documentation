== HT Controller

The bridge HT interface supports a maximum bi-directional 16-bit data width and an operating frequency of 2.0 GHz.
After the connection is established by automatic system initialization, the user can change the width and operating frequency and re-initialize by modifying the corresponding configuration registers in the protocol.

The main features of the bridge HT interface are as follows:

* Support HT1.0/3.0 protocol

* Support 200/400/800/1600/2000 MHz operating frequency

* Support 8/16 bit width

* Support dual processors with bridge chip direct connection (each link can only work in 8-bit mode)
