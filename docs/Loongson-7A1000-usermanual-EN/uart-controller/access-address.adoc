=== Access Address

The access base address of the UART controller is the base address of the MISC low-speed device block plus offset `0x0`. Note: The UART module supports byte access only.

The 4 UART controllers are distinguished by bit `[9:8]`, and the internal physical address division of the UART module is shown in the following table.
