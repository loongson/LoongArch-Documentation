=== Introduction to Loongson 3A5000/3B5000

The Loongson 3A5000/3B5000 is a quad-core Loongson processor with a stable operating frequency of `2.0`-`2.5GHz`.

The main technical features are as follows:

* On-chip integration of four 64-bit quad-launch superscalar GS464v processor cores.

* Peak floating-point computing power `160GFLOPS@2.5GHz`.

* On-chip integration of 16MB of split shared tertiary Cache.

* Maintenance of Cache consistency for multi-core and I/O DMA accesses via directory protocol.

* On-chip integration of two 72-bit DDR4 controllers with ECC, supporting DDR4-3200.

* On-chip integration of two 16-bit HyperTransport controllers (hereinafter referred to as HT) with a maximum bus frequency of `3.2` GHz.

* Each group of 16-bit HT ports can be split into two groups of 8-bit HT ports for use.

* `2` `I2C`, `1` UART, `1` SPI, `16` GPIO interfaces on-chip


The architecture of the Loongson 3A5000/3B5000 is designed to increase the shared Cache capacity based on the 3A4000 and supports 16-way interconnect.

The Loongson 3B5000 supports consistent interconnects on the `HT0` interface compared to the 3A5000, with special filtering based on server scenario requirements.
There is no difference in the other parts from the hardware and software perspective, and they are collectively referred to as 3A5000.

The overall architecture of the Loongson 3A5000 chip is based on multi-level interconnects and is shown in the figure below.

The first level of interconnect uses a `5 &#215; 5` frequency division switch to connect four GS464v cores (as masters), four shared Cache modules (as slaves), and one I/O port to I/O-RING (The I/O port uses one Master and one Slave).

The second level interconnect uses a `5 &#215; 3` cross-switch to connect four shared Cache modules (as masters), two DDR3/4 memory controllers, and one I/O port to the I/O-RING.

The I/O-RING contains `8` ports and the connections include `4` HT controllers, MISC module, SE module and two level cross switches.
The two HT controllers (lo/hi) share the 16-bit HT bus, which is used as two 8-bit HT buses, or lo can occupy the 16-bit HT bus exclusively.
A DMA controller is integrated into the HT controller, which is responsible for the DMA control of the I/O and the maintenance of inter-chip consistency.

All of these interconnect structures use read/write separated data channels with a 128-bit data channel width operating at the same frequency as the processor core to provide high-speed on-chip data transport.
In addition, a one-level cross-switch connects the four processor cores to the SCache with a 256-bit read data channel to increase the read bandwidth of the on-chip processor cores accessing the SCache.
