== Chip Configuration Register

The chip configuration registers in the Loongson3A5000 provide a mechanism for reading and writing configuration of various functions of the chip. The individual configuration registers are described in detail below.

The base address of each chip configuration register in this chapter is 0x1fe00000, which can also be accessed using the configuration register instruction (IOCSR).

CSR[A][B] in this document indicates bit B in the IOCSR register with offset address A, where B can be a range.
