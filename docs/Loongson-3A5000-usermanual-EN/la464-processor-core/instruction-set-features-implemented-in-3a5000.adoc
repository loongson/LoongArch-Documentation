=== Instruction set features implemented in 3A5000

The functional features of the Loongson instruction set implemented in the Loongson 3A5000 can be dynamically confirmed by the Loongson instruction set attribute identification mechanism.

The CPUCFG instruction is a user-state instruction, which is used as CPUCFG rd, rj, where the source operand rj register holds the register number of the configuration information word to be accessed, and the returned configuration word information is written to the rd register, each configuration information word contains up to 32 bits of configuration information.
For example, bit 0 of configuration word 1 indicates whether the LA32 architecture is implemented, then this configuration information is expressed as CPUCFG.1.LA32[bit0], where 1 means that the font size of the configuration information word is 1, LA32 means that the helper name of this configuration information field is LA32, and bit 0 means that the field LA32 is located in bit 0 of the configuration word.
If the configuration information needs to be expressed in multiple bits, then the location information will be recorded in the form of bitAA:BB, which means the consecutive (AA-BB+1) bits from the AAth to the BBth bit of the configuration information word.

The following table gives a list of configuration information for the instruction set functions implemented in the 3A5000.
The last column, "`Possible Value`", indicates a possible value to be read from this register, but does not imply that this is the value to be read from the 3A5000 processor.
Please refer to the results of the actual hardware execution of the instruction, and make subsequent software judgments based on the actual read values.
