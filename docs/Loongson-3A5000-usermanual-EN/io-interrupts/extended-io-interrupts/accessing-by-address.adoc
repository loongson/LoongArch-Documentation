==== Accessing by Address

The following are the associated extended I/O interrupt registers.
As with the other configuration registers, the base address can be used as `0x1fe00000`, or can be accessed via the processor core's dedicated register configuration instructions.

Similar to legacy I/O interrupts, the 256-bit interrupt source for Extended I/O interrupts can be software-configured to select the target processor core for the desired interrupt.

However, the interrupt sources are not individually selected to route to any of the processor core interrupts INT0 through INT3, but rather the routing of INT interrupts is done in groups.
The following are the interrupt pin routing registers configured by group.

Starting with the 3A5000, the interrupt pin routing bits have been added in a coded manner and are enabled by the `CSR[0x420][49]` bit control.
When this bit is enabled, the `[3:0]` bits in the table below changes from a bitmap representation to a numeric encoding method.
Configurable values `0`-`7` indicate interrupt pins `0`-`7`.
For example, in this mode, `0x2` indicates routing to `INT2`.

Each interrupt source additionally corresponds to an 8-bit routing controller with the format and address shown in <<description-of-the-interrupt-destination-processor-core-routing-register,Description of the interrupt destination processor core routing register>> and <<interrupt-destination-processor-core-routing-register-address,Interrupt destination processor core routing register address>>.
The `[7:4]` bits are used to select the real node routing vector in <<interrupt-destination-node-mapping-method-configuration,Interrupt destination node mapping method configuration>>.
The routing register uses a vector approach for routing, e.g., `0x48` indicates a route to processor core 3 of the node referred to by `EXT_IOI_node_type4`.

|===

Note that when using the rotating distribution mode (corresponding to an `EXT_IOIbounce` of `1`), rotate on the fully mapped mode of node number to processor core number.
The setting of `EXT_IOIbounce` should follow the associated route mapping configuration.

For example, when the setting in the tables above is `0x27` and the setting of `EXT_IOI_node_type2` in the the tables below is `0x0013`, the interrupt will rotate in turn on node 0 core 0, node 0 core 1, node 0 core 2, node 1 core 0, node 1 core 1, node 1 core 2, node 4 core 0, node 4 core 1, and node 4 core 2.

When using fixed distribution mode (corresponding to an `EXT_IOIbounce` of `0`), only one bit on the bitmap of the node number is allowed to be `1`, or all `0` values, corresponding to local triggering.
