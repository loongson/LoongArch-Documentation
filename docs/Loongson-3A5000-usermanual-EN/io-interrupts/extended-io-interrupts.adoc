=== Extended I/O Interrupts

In addition to being compatible with the legacy I/O interrupt method, the 3A5000 supports extended I/O interrupts, which are used to distribute 256-bit interrupts on the HT bus directly to each processor core instead of forwarding them through the HT interrupt line, increasing the flexibility of I/O interrupt usage.

Before the core can use the extended I/O interrupt, it needs to enable the corresponding bit in the "`Other function configuration register`".
This register has a base address of `0x1fe00000`,It can also be accessed using the configuration register instruction (IOCSR), an offset address of `0x0420`.

In Extended I/O interrupt mode, HT interrupts can be forwarded directly across slices and distributed in rotation.
In the current version, up to `s` extended interrupt vectors can be supported.
