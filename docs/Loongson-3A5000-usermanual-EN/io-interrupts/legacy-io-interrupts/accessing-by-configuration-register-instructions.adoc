==== Accessing by Configuration Register Instructions

In the Loongson 3A5000, the configuration registers can also be accessed through private space using the same access method as the configuration register instruction.
The offset address used by the instruction is the same as that accessed through the address.
In addition, for the convenience of users, a dedicated private interrupt status register is set for different current interrupt states of each core, as shown in the following table.
