== I/O Interrupts

The Loongson 3A5000 chip supports two different interrupt methods.
The first is the legacy interrupt method, which is compatible with processors such as the 3A3000, and the second is the new extended I/O interrupt method, which is used to support the interrupt cross-chip and dynamic distribution functions of the HT controller.
The following describes each of the two interrupt methods.
