== Introduction

test

This is the translation of LoongArch documentation.

* You can find documents online https://loongson.github.io/LoongArch-Documentation[here].

* You can find all historical versions here https://github.com/loongson/LoongArch-Documentation/releases[here].

The HTML versions are more readable than the PDF versions, not only because there exists tables of excessive length, but also because the theme of html versions is easier to customize.
To make it easier to download, each HTML page contains embedded CSS and images.

== Getting Start

We *strongly recommend* that you develop on Linux/UNIX or macOS.
If you want to develop on Windows, see <<Developing on Windows>> first.

. Make sure the https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads[Ruby development environment] is installed.

. Install bunlder:
+
[source]
----
gem install bundler
----

. Clone this project:
+
[source]
----
git clone https://github.com/loongson/LoongArch-Documentation
----

. Enter the project repo and install the gems into the project using the bundle command (this will take a while, during which time about `20MB` of data will be downloaded):
+
[source]
----
cd LoongArch-Documentation && bundle config set --local path .bundle/gems && bundle
----

. Now you can generate the documents.
+
* Convert AsciiDoc to both HTML and PDF:

[source]
----
bundle exec rake book:all
----

== Questions

[qanda]
Are there any prerequisites I need to take?::
Install the environment refer to the <<Getting Start>>, and then see <<References>> for more information.

Why not use autogenerated section IDs?::
Due to many duplicate titles, custom section IDs (`+[[id]]+`) are better when being referenced (`+<<id,name>>+`).

Why not use named HTML entities?::
Asciidoctor PDF doesn`'t support all named HTML entities (e.g. `+&times;+`), so you have to use entity numbers (e.g. `+&#215;+`) here.

Are there any convenience tools?::
See https://github.com/FreeFlyingSheep/golang-asciidoc-tools[Golang AsciiDoc Tools] for tools that may be useful (e.g. for generating a list of tables).

The HTML versions of documents will be deployed automatically, while the PDF versions will be published manually.
If you find an issue about the documents as found on the https://github.com/loongson/LoongArch-Documentation/releases[release page], please cross-check that it is still present in this repo.
The issue may have already been corrected, but the changes have not been published yet.

Branch `gh-pages` is generated by https://docs.github.com/en/actions[Github Actions], which is used to publish a project site by https://docs.github.com/en/pages[Github Pages].
So you should not modify this branch directly.

== Troubleshooting

=== Developing on Windows

Some of the file paths are so long that they exceed the 260-character limit of the Windows API, which can cause some strange problems.

In Windows 10 version 1607 and later, these problems can be solved.
If you are using an earlier version, or if you don`'t want to do some extra operations, you might consider using docker, refer to <<Developing on Docker>> for more details.

. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/maximum-file-path-limitation#enable-long-paths-in-windows-10-version-1607-and-later[Enable] long paths.

. Use the latest https://git-scm.com/downloads[Git].
Run `git config --global core.longpaths true` to modify the global configuration or run `git config core.longpaths true` in the repo to modify the local configuration.

. Use the latest https://www.jruby.org/download[JRuby] instead of Ruby.

The rest is the same as in <<Getting Start>>, but JRuby runs much slower and may have cmd popups when running commands.

=== Developing on Docker

We assume you know how to develop with https://www.docker.com[Docker].
If you don`'t, please refer to the https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview[official tutorial].

You may find the official https://hub.docker.com/r/asciidoctor/docker-asciidoctor[Docker container] useful.
